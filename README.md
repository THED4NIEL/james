analytical toolkit for BSC

## Goal:
### Create a program/ecosystem of tools to:
* query transactions
* analyze transactions and money flow
* identify wallet relations (ownership)
* identify selloffs, red flags, top-sellers, whales, etc.
* display data in best human-readable form
* display relations and money flow in an easy-to-follow way
* create a report of analyzed data which is easily digestable
* offline blockchain query (Blockscout, resource-intense) or online via third-party API (BSCscan, query-limited)
